# Cycles ShapeNet
This script adjusts the objects in ShapeNet, enabling their texture to be better visualized using the Cycles path tracer in Blender.

**Note 1:** this is an initial version of the code with a temporary solution. The objects are much improved, but artifacts are still present (as can be seen in the white portions of the propeller, in the "After" image above). I'll continue to improve this repository as I finish coding the proper solution to replace this quick fix.

**Note 2:** the outputs of this script might not look right at all with Eevee, please make sure you're using Cycles.
